fast alles geklaut von <b>CHO</b> <br>
<br>
First try of automating PT as good as possible -> as Failsave as Possible<br>
<br>
<b>chmod +x *.sh</b><br>
first start <b>passive_recon.sh</b> for netdiscover and PCredz in tmux <br>
this should run the whole test to gather all Credz -> beware it's <b>dfitmux.conf</b>!<br>
<small>maybe not compatible with iTerm tmux integration.</small><br><br>
enter <b>tmux a</b>, create a new window and start <b>auto_pt.sh</b>.<br>
Now you have time to check external.
